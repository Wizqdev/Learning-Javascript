// In Lesson One We Already Saw Some Examples Of Maths
// Like..
2 + 2; // 4
// "+" Means Addition


10 - 7; // 3
// "-" Means Subtraction


// We Can Also Multiply..
10 * 3; // 30
// * Symbol Means Multiplication


// We Can Also Divide 
10 / 2; // 5
// "/" Means Division



// Synxtax Rules For Numbers
// The Synxtax For Maths In Javascript Is Pretty Much Same
// +, -, *, / Etc..

// We Can Also Maths More Than 2 Numbers
// Like..
2 + 2 + 2; // 6


// Javascript Can Handle Decimal Numbers Aswell
2.2 + 2.2; // 4.4

// In Javascript "*" And "/" Have Same Priority And "+" And "-" Have Same Proirity 
// And "*" And "/" Have More Priority Than "+" And "-" So In Calculation First "*" Or "/" Is Ran Than "+" Or "-"

// You Can Priority Which Should Be Ran By Using "()" Brackets!
// Here's Some Example
( 1 + 1 ) * 3; // 6
// So In This Above Code First Inside The Bracket Will Be Calculated (1 + 1) Which Is 2 Then 2 * 3 Will Be Calculated Which Is 6


// In Programing.. 
// 2,3,4,5 = Integers
// 2.2,3.3,4.4,5.5 = Float
    // Computers Have A Problem Working With Float
    // Here's Some Example

0.1 + 0.2  // 0.300000000004
 

// So Float Is Not Acurate For Everything But Some
// So While Caculating Money. 
// Lets Convert The $ To Cent First 
// Lets Take A Example Of Adding 20.50 + 30.75
    // So 20.5 In Cents Is 2050 Cents And 30.75 Is 3575 Cents
    // So Its Gona Be Like..
((2050 + 3575) / 100) // Then You Will Get 56.252

    // So In This Example Convert The $ To Cents First Then Calculate Then Divide By 100 To Get The Exact Value
